        <h2 class="section__header">Cancer cell treatment using Oncolytic Viruses</h2>
        <P1>
          A new medic research has been carried out for the treatment of cancer cells.
Oncolytic viruses represent a novel approach to cancer treatment, utilizing viruses that selectively infect and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. These viruses can disrupt the force field-like protection around tumors and expose cancer cells to the immune system, leading to an immune response that can further destroy tumor cells.
However, there are also limitations to this approach, such as the body's highly evolved capacity to deal with viral infections, which can lead to rapid clearance of viruses before they reach their intended tumor targets</P1>

        <h2 class="section__header">Research on Mantras in medical field</h2>
        <P1>
          It is not unknown to people today the scientific sides behind hyms or Mantra for their special frequency that manipulates human body organs. 
Mantra sound frequencies have been increasingly recognized for their potential benefits in the medical field. Research suggests that the vibrational frequencies of mantras can have a profound impact on both physical and mental health.The power of mantras lies in their ability to elicit specific brainwaves that promote relaxation, alertness, focus, and even aid in entering a meditative state. This stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which in turn supports the body's organs and tissues in resting, healing, and regenerating. Furthermore, sound healing is used to release 'blocked' energy from subtle energy channels, restoring balance to emotions.</P1>

        <P1>
          Recent advancements in the neurological field of medical science have been marked by significant progress in nanotherapeutics, brain inflammation studies in children, medical big data analysis for neurological diseases, and research on conditions like patent foramen ovale (PFO) and long COVID's neurological impacts. These studies highlight the growing focus on innovative treatments, diagnostic technologies, and understanding the complex interactions within the nervous system. From nanotherapies for neurodegenerative diseases to computer-aided diagnosis systems for neurological abnormalities, the research landscape is evolving to address the challenges posed by neurological disorders and enhance patient care.</P1>
